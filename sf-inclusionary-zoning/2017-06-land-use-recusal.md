When a new apartment goes up in San Francisco, the developers are required to
rent a percentage of units at or below SF's area median income. This policy is
called inclusionary zoning, and the exact percentage of units is up for debate.
In 2014 SF's voters chose to raise the percentage to 25%, a number that's made
many projects infeasible and killed the rate of new housing development in SF.

All of the proposals to fix the percentage that are currently on the table
will force San Francisco's renters to pay $1.8 billion in additional rent to
San Francisco's landlords over the next 15 years, compared to the pre-Prop C
baseline. The city's chief economist estimates that the laxest proposal (17% of
units must be rented below market rate) will raise rents by 1.5%.

Supervisor Aaron Peskin, one of the strongest proponents for high percentages of
inclusionary zoning, is also a landlord. High inclusionary zoning percentages
increase the amount of rent he can charge to tenants. Assuming Peskin rents a 1
bedroom unit for $3000, a 1.5% increase in market rate rent means he's going to
get $45 extra per month, $540 extra per year, as a baseline, compared to the
pre-Prop C levels.

The city's chief economist has estimated that, past the baseline of 17%, a
1% increase in the inclusionary zoning percentage would add 12 additional
subsidized BMR units per year, but raise home values and citywide rents by
0.15%. If 12 subsidized BMR units each provide $2000 a month in rent relief,
that's about $285,000 in rent relief per year for 12 lucky families.

However, the first year of a 0.15% rent increase would amount to $2.5 million in
additional rent being transferred from San Francisco renters to San Francisco
landlords, according to the chief economist. That's assuming 13% of renters move
every year; 13% of the city paying a little bit more in rent is 2.5 million
dollars. The next year, as more people move and pay higher rents, that number
increases to about $5 million. Over 15 years, the city's market rate renters
will pay a total of $230 million more per percentage point increase in the
inclusionary zoning numbers.

We can quibble over the exact numbers, but that's a pretty expensive way
of buying rent relief. The numbers also seem to be borne out by the severe drop
in new housing starts in San Francisco, which will drive up prices for existing
housing.

If San Francisco were a charity, paying $2.5 million to get $285,000 in rent
relief would be like spending 89% of your budget on overhead. It's an extremely
expensive to buy rent relief for 12 extra families per year. Most families
making below the area median income aren't lucky enough to be in subsidized BMR
housing, and would pay higher rent if they moved.

A 0.15% rent increase from a 1% increase in the IZ percentage would mean
Supervisor Peskin would get an additional $5 per month/$60 per year. That's
$60 per year out of his renters pockets and into his own pocket, for every one
percent increase in the inclusionary zoning percentage. His plan initially asked
for 6% higher inclusionary zoning than Supervisors Breed and Safai, or roughly
$60*6 = $360 more per year.

These are not the largest numbers, but they represent a conflict of interest,
and demonstrate how landlords can benefit from policies that purport to help the
city's worst off.

I would be satisfied if Supervisor Peskin published information each year on the
amount of rent he charges his tenants, and/or to commit to increasing rent each
year by no more than the Rent Board allows, even if a new tenant moves in. All
San Franciscans have an interest in good governance, and these steps would help
this.

Supervisor Peskin should consider that only 4% of the city's renters have
subsidized BMR protection, and everyone else would also get hit by the increases
being proposed. The majority of city residents making below the area median
income are not in that 4% group.
