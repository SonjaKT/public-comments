Hi, I'm a small business owner and a market rate renter.

I would like to request that Supervisor Peskin consider recusing himself
from votes on inclusionary housing. Supervisor Peskin is a landlord, and has
frequently spoken out in favor of higher inclusionary percentages.

The city's chief economist has estimated that a 1% increase in the inclusionary
zoning percentage would add 50 additional subsidized BMR units per year, but
raise home values and citywide rents by 1%. If 50 subsidized BMR units each
provide $2000 a month in rent relief, that's about $1 million in rent relief per
year for below market tenants.

However, the first year of a 1% rent increase would amount to $20 million in
additional rent being transferred from San Francisco renters to San Francisco
landlords, according to the chief economist. That's assuming 13% of renters move
every year; 13% of the city paying 1% more in rent is 20 million dollars. We can
quibble over the exact numbers but that's a pretty expensive way of buying rent
relief. The numbers also seem to be borne out by the severe drop in new housing
starts in San Francisco, which will drive up prices for existing housing, since
demand is still high.

If San Francisco were a charity, paying $20 million to get $1 million in rent
relief would be like spending 95% of your budget on overhead. This is an
extremely expensive to buy rent relief for 50 extra families per year.

I'm not sure what Supervisor Peskin's apartment holdings look like, but let's
say he rents a 1 bedroom apartment for 3000 dollars, average for North Beach.
A 1% rent increase would mean he could rent the apartment for $3030 per month
when his tenant moves out. That's an additional $360 per year out of his
renters pockets and into his own pocket, for every one percent increase in
the inclusionary zoning percentage. His plan initially asked for 6% more
inclusionary zoning than Supervisors Breed and Safai, or roughly 360*6 = $2160
more per year.

I think that represents a conflict of interest, especially when you consider
that we're talking about $20 million more per year for landlords and only $1
million in rent relief for tenants. It's not clear that Supervisor Peskin is
voting with the city's best interests at heart.

I would also be satisfied if Supervisor Peskin would publish information each
year on the amount of rent he charges his tenants, and/or commit to increasing
rent each year by no more than the Rent Board allows, even if a new tenant moves
in.

I urge Supervisor Peskin to recuse himself, or failing that, to consider that
only 4% of the city's renters have subsidized BMR protection, and everyone
else would also get hit by the increases being proposed. The majority of city
residents making below the area median income are not in that 4% group.
