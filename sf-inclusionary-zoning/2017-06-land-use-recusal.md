My name is Kevin Burke, I'm a small business owner and a market rate renter.

I would like to request that Supervisor Peskin recuse himself from votes on
inclusionary housing. Supervisor Peskin is a landlord, and has frequently spoken
out in favor of higher inclusionary percentages.

The city's chief economist has estimated that a 1% increase in the inclusionary
zoning percentage would add 50 additional subsidized BMR units per year, but
raise home values and citywide rents by 1%. If 50 subsidized BMR units each
provide $2000 a month in rent relief, that's $1 million in rent relief per year
for below market tenants.

However, the first year of a 1% rent increase would amount to $20 million in
additional rent being paid by San Francisco renters to landlords, according
to the chief economist. That's assuming 13% of renters move every year; 13%
of the city paying 1% more in rent is 20 million dollars. We can quibble over
the exact numbers but that's a pretty expensive way of buying rent relief. If
San Francisco were a charity it would be like spending 95% of your budget on
overhead.

Let's say Supervisor Peskin rents a 1 bedroom apartment for 3000 dollars.
A 1% rent increase would mean he could rent the apartment for $3030 per
month when his tenant moves out. That's an additional $360 per year out of
renters pockets and into his own pocket, for every one percent increase in the
inclusionary zoning percentage. His plan asks for 6% more inclusionary zoning
than Supervisors Breed and Safai.

I think that's a conflict of interest, especially when you consider that we're
talking about $20 million more per year for landlords and only $1 million in
rent relief for tenants. It's not clear that Supervisor Peskin has the city's
best interests at heart.

Furthermore, there's precedent. The Chair recused himself from a 2015 vote
involving AirBNB because he had interests with AirBnB.

I urge Supe Peskin to recuse himself, or failing that, to consider that only 4%
of the city's renters have subsidized BMR protection, and everyone else would
also get hit by the increases being proposed.
