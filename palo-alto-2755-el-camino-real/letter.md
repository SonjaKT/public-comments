I'm a small business owner and a Belmont resident. My girlfriend and I are trying to save up to buy a home.

This is made more difficult by the lack of supply of housing in the area. Santa Clara County added 200,000 jobs between 2010 and 2016, and only added 30,000 units of housing. You would expect to see prices and rents rising very quickly and in fact that's what you see.

We could use a lot more housing. More housing will help offset further increases in the price of rent. This puts more money in renters pockets and helps Palo Alto's city employees and workers stay in their home town.

Lower rents also increase the economic vitality of the region. It's easier to start a company when rents are lower because you don't need to make as much money to make the business economics work.

2755 El Camino Real is an ideal project. The units, while small, would be in a price range that's helpful for the middle class. It's close to Caltrain - exactly where we should be building dense housing without a lot of parking.

The project may not have that much parking, but the Council should recognize that parking spaces increase the cost of a building and therefore making housing development projects less viable. There's also a lot of evidence that we will need fewer cars on the road in the future, both due to the rise of convenient ride sharing and car-rental apps, the increased viability of Caltrain, and autonomous vehicles. We can create a virtuous cycle where renters walk and bike more, increasing the desirability and pedestrian friendliness of the downtown area.

In any event, I would much rather have a parking crisis than a housing crisis. Many South Bay families pay more than half their income in rent, and Palo Alto companies can't hire workers they need.

I would encourage the Council to do what it can to speed this project through the planning process. I urge you to consider relaxing the parking requirements for downtown buildings to make buildings like this one a) more viable and b) to make the zoning code align with the Council's wishes for less parking downtown.

Thanks very much,
Kevin
