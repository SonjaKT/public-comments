This is a list of comments I've either made at meetings or written to public
officials.

I'm making this list public because I shared a letter once and it ended up on
Slate.com, so it seems useful.

## Housing Approval Talking Points

- We've failed to build housing to keep up with the numbers of jobs we're
creating (see per-county stats below). This leads to high prices and longer
commutes.

- I would rather deal with an X crisis (parking, traffic, zucchini) than a
housing crisis.

- Building infill housing close to transit is good for the environment.

- The fastest growing cities in the Bay Area are [Brentwood, Gilroy, Rio Vista,
all out in the suburbs][sprawl], all single family homes with lawns, mostly
people with long commutes. We should be building more infill development instead
of pushing people to the outskirts of the Bay Area.

- **Building housing lowers rents** - SF built 5000 units last year and saw
  rents drop.

    - Areas that build the most housing relative to population change see the
    lowest price increases: https://twitter.com/lenkiefer/status/871785655164182529

- **Building housing lowers move-in evictions** - SF built 5000 units last year,
  a record, and owner move-in evictions dropped.

## Market Rate vs BMR

Only 4% of San Francisco renters are in subsidized below-market-rate housing.
The rest of the city, including the majority of people making below the area's
annual median income, rent in units that reset to the market rate when a new
tenant moves in.

"Market rate" also counts units that rent for less than the average - a Richmond
house built in 1940 that rents for $1000 a month is "market rate".

A 1% increase in the market rate rent translates to an extra $20 million per
year paid by tenants to landlords. 13% of tenants move each year; these 13%
paying an extra 1% translates to $20 million. Over 15 years, as more people move
and start paying the extra 1%, the total transfer from tenants to landlords is
$1.5 billion. (All numbers according to San Francisco's chief economist)

## Planning Commission Project Approval Talking Points

- If neighbors are concerned with a project that complies with existing zoning,
they should purchase an easement that prevents the property owner from (building
too tall/casting a shadow/replacing a tree). If they do not do that the Planning
Commission should conclude that the property owner values the housing more than
the neighbors value sunlight. There is no need for the Planning Commission to
get involved.

- There is no "right to sunlight" in the USA. Making decisions based on sunlight
for neighbors implies your neighbors have some sort of covenant over your
property above and beyond what the zoning code says. This is unfair to the
property owner.

- By amending or delaying a project that complies with zoning codes we are
rewarding the neighbor for a lack of knowledge of zoning codes and foresight
about the types of buildings that might be built nearby.

## Job Creation vs. Housing Creation By SFBA County

Jobs data comes from
https://data.edd.ca.gov/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rates/Local-Area-Unemployment-Statistics-LAUS-Annual-Ave/7jbb-3rb8

"Jobs" is counting the number of employed people.
