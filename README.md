This is a list of comments I've either made at meetings or written to public
officials.

I'm making this list public because I shared a letter once and it ended up on
Slate.com, so it seems useful.

## Housing Approval Talking Points

- We've failed to build housing to keep up with the numbers of jobs we're
creating (see per-county stats below). This leads to high prices and longer
commutes.

- I would rather deal with an X crisis (parking, traffic, zucchini) than a
housing crisis.

- Building infill housing close to transit is good for the environment.

- The fastest growing cities in the Bay Area are [Brentwood, Gilroy, Rio Vista,
all out in the suburbs][sprawl], all single family homes with lawns, mostly
people with long commutes. We should be building more infill development instead
of pushing people to the outskirts of the Bay Area.

## Planning Commission Project Approval Talking Points

- If neighbors are concerned with a project that complies with existing zoning,
they should purchase an easement that prevents the property owner from (building
too tall/casting a shadow/replacing a tree). If they do not do that the Planning
Commission should conclude that the property owner values the housing more than
the neighbors value sunlight. There is no need for the Planning Commission to
get involved.

- There is no "right to sunlight" in the USA. Making decisions based on sunlight
for neighbors implies your neighbors have some sort of covenant over your
property above and beyond what the zoning code says. This is unfair to the
property owner.

- By amending or delaying a project that complies with zoning codes we are
rewarding the neighbor for a lack of knowledge of zoning codes and foresight
about the types of buildings that might be built nearby.
