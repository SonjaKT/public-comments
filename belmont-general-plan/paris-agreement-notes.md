I just moved to Belmont with my girlfriend. renter and a Bay Area resident. I’ve been living in the Bay Area my whole life. Currently I’m trying to save up to buy a home with my girlfriend.

Paris Agreement withdrawal
Environment - where is the best place to put people?
- low A/C use
- Low water use (density)
- Good public transit
- Close to jobs

Basically, Belmont

Sprawl is a really big problem in the Bay Area
- Gilroy, Brentwood, Rio Vista

Affordability crisis
- 3-4x the average income
- Now 10x ($1.5 million)
- Young people in the city vision statement
- Building housing helps

Young people are spending more and more of their money on rent. Since 2010 California has added 2.3 million residents and only 400,000 new housing units. This would be as if Levi's Stadium added 15,000 new seats but didn’t buy any more concessions for football games.

You’d end up with shortages or higher concession prices. We can legislate that hot dog prices should be lower, or crackdown on illegal sales, but ultimately they just need more supply and our region needs more places for people to live, not fewer.

Chance to kill two birds with one stone - help the environment and help affordability.

The same way you’d get more hot dogs to avoid a shortage at the concession stand, building more housing can help alleviate rent problems. Areas of SF that built the most new housing saw the lowest rent increases, and the least displacement. Just last year SF built 5000 units, a record, and rents and owner move-in evictions both fell. Seattle has been building more housing than SF and has seen lower rent increases.

You expressed dismay about Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.

Downzoning would increase the value of existing homes in Berkeley, since there would be more competition . But it’s not clear that homeowners and landlords need another break. Property values have increased by about 50% in ten years, and homeowners already have property taxes capped by Prop 13, in addition to being able to deduct interest on the mortgage. I cannot deduct rent payment from my taxes.

Downzoning would betray Berkeley’s history as a progressive city and as an environmental leader, and position it to transfer more rent from renters and the city’s poorest and give it to homeowners. It would mark Berkeley as a leading contributor to the area’s sprawl, and hurt the city’s employees and teachers even more. Please don’t vote to downzone the city tonight.
