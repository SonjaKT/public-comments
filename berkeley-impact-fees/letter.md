I'm writing in opposition to the proposed amendments in Item 41 to add impact
fees to development. We've added lots of new jobs in the Bay Area but not lots
of new housing, which has led to price increases. We should be doing everything
we can to make it easier to build housing, not harder.

Berkeley already imposes high costs on developers, through a lengthy and
uncertain planning process. To add additional fees onto this is going to
discourage developers from building projects. It may make some projects
unworkable, especially for nonprofit developers and people who don't have very
much money to build a project. It will also probably increase rents, since
developers will require a higher return to make projects feasible.

I urge you to at least conduct a study before imposing higher new fees on new
developments in Berkeley.

If you are determined to pass higher impact fees, please consider pairing
with other proposals that make it easier to build housing in Berkeley. For
example, consider making it more difficult for people to appeal project
applications, lowering the required IZ percentage (which has almost entirely
stalled new housing proposals in San Francisco), or some other streamlining of
the application process, that introduces more certainty into the process.

Thanks,
Kevin
