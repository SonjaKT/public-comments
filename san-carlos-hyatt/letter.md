I'm a Belmont resident and a renter. I hope you will vote to approve the Hyatt
at Laurel and Spring as is.

San Mateo County is in desperate need of more space for hotels. The hotels in
the area routinely fill up. When there aren't enough hotels for everyone who
wants to stay here, landlords and visitors turn to AirBNB instead.

San Mateo County is in desperate need of more space for
housing. SMC added 75,000 jobs and only 4,000 new housing
units since 2010. As a result, [rents have literally
doubled](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/santa-clara-c
ounty/santa-clara/) in that time frame. Cumulatively the lack of new housing
supply has pushed renters to the outskirts of the Bay - the fastest growing
cities in the area are all on the Bay Area's outskirts, Gilroy, Livermore,
Brentwood, Rio Vista.

Adding more space for hotels will reduce the incentive for landlords to offer
apartments on AirBNB. This should add more units for renters, and in turn, this
means fewer people living and commuting from Gilroy to San Mateo County. I'm not
sure that this environmental impact is measured in the EIR for the Hyatt, but I
think it outweighs any harm from shadows or views.

I would add that this project appears to comply with the region's zoning, and
homeowners in the area should have known about the potential for a 4 story
building to be built there before they bought their own homes. To downsize the
project would be to reward these homeowners for a lack of foresight about the
nature of future development near their home, and to suggest that the Hyatt
project's neighbors have a covenant on their property above and beyond what the
zoning code suggests.

Please vote to certify the EIR and approve the project as is.

Thanks,
Kevin
