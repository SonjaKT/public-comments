# Housing Accountability Act

The HAA ties cities hands in very specific ways. If an application meets the
following criteria:

- It has a valid Environmental Impact Report (EIR)

- It complies with "objective plan and zoning standards." All cities have rules
about what type of buildings can be built in which locations, collectively, the
zoning code. Sometimes projects _don't_ comply with those codes, or need special
permission to waive e.g. a required number of parking units. Look for words like
"variance".

- It would not cause a "significant, adverse impact to public health", which has
never been tested in court, but I take to mean something like the application is
on top of a superfund site or something.

The city is _legally required_ to approve the project, and all necessary permits
for the project (Land Use, Demolition, Design, etc). They are _forbidden under
the law_ from asking the developer to reduce the number of units in the project.

If they do deny the project, or ask it to reduce the number of units, they must
_make a written finding_ that it violates "objective plan and zoning standards."
Lots of cities don't do this.

#### What this means

Cities can't use adhoc and arbitrary criteria to deny housing proposals. Any
criteria that the city wants to use to deny the project must be embedded in the
objective standards in the zoning code.

- If you want to say a building is too tall, you have to embed "too tall" into
the zoning code with height limits.

- If you want to say a proposal does not fit with the neighborhood, you have to
  embed "neighborhood character" into the zoning code, e.g. "All buildings on
  this block need to have a Spanish facade."

- If you want to say a project would cast shadows, you have to embed shadows
into the zoning code. (This is a horrible idea, but you get the picture)

#### Your job as a public participant

Many City Councils, City Managers and City Attorneys are unfamiliar with their
requirements under the HAA. Use the public comment section to remind the City
Council that if they want to reject the project or reduce the number of units,
they are legally required to make a written finding explaining which "objective
plan and zoning standards" are not being met.

Before the meeting check the City Council agenda. Find the staff report attached
to the agenda item you are interested in. The staff report should mention the
City's obligations under the HAA. If it doesn't, or if you're not satisfied,
consider leaving the following comment:

> Hi, I'm [introduce yourself]. I would like to remind the council of their
> obligations under the Housing Accountability Act. Specifically, if you vote
> to reject the project, or want to reduce the number of units, the Housing
> Accountability Act requires you to make a written finding explaining why the
> project does not meet "objective plan or zoning standards."
>
> Several other people have raised complaints about (shadows/height/neighborhood
> character/adjust as appropriate). These complaints are not reflected in the
> City's objective plan and zoning standards, and the project complies with
> (height limits/design guidelines). As such, it would be illegal for the City
> to consider this feedback when deciding whether to approve this project.

> The goal of the Housing Accountability Act is to introduce certainty into the
> application process, and address the regional housing shortage. Please vote to
> approve the project as is.

#### Where the HAA doesn't apply

- It doesn't apply to Environmental Impact Report certifications. If you are
  attending a meeting called "EIR appeal", you can't cite the HAA.

    *However*, there's an important caveat. The EIR may specify that any of
    several options may be acceptable, for example, 200 apartments OR 40
    single-family homes. A city can't force a developer to choose the plan with
    the fewer number of units. See [Sequoyah Hills Homeowners Association vs.
    City of Oakland][haa-oakland].

- It doesn't apply to a General or Specific Plan, which has details about how
various areas should be zoned. For example, the Brisbane Baylands project is
a Specific Plan, outlining what types of buildings can be built on the land.
The HAA only applies to specific housing applications. Indeed downzoning is a
legitimate (but very unfortunate) response to HAA obligations.

- It doesn't apply if the project needs some special variance from the zoning
code. For example, a project in Palo Alto wanted to build fewer parking spaces
than the zoning code allowed. That would be a valid reason to deny the project,
or ask for a reduction in units.

    The exception is if the developer is using the State Density Bonus to build
    more units and exceed local height limits. This height limit increase is
    protected by the HAA.
