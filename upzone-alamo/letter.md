Supervisor Andersen,
My name is <your name>. I grew up in Alamo, but I can't afford to live there. No one I grew up with can afford to live there either; literally everyone I went to middle school with has moved out, or still lives with their parents.

It used to be feasible to buy homes in the East Bay for 3-4x the area median income. Now that number is about 8-10x.

The affordability problem is bad enough, but there's a lot of evidence that it's actively getting worse; home price increases continue to outpace increases in salaries. Since 2010, Contra Costa County has added 63,900 jobs, and only 9,520 new housing units. This means it's getting even harder for our young people to afford homes, and the ones that can are getting pushed out to Brentwood or Rio Vista or squeezed into units with other people. Your reelection website mentioned fixing gridlock on 680, and people commuting long distances from Livermore and Brentwood certainly aren't helping with traffic problems.

I think Alamo could do a better job of providing places for people to live, and helping to solve the affordability crisis, and take on a larger share of the RHNA target for Contra Costa County's unincorporated areas (3508 housing units). Alamo is a prime location for more housing: we are very close to the Walnut Creek transit center and job centers in Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Danville, and San Ramon.

The majority of Alamo is zoned as R-20, single family housing on lots of a minimum size of 20,000 square feet, with the exception of a tiny area near Cherubini's that's zoned for apartments. I would like you to consider upzoning more parts of Alamo to D-1, which would allow for the construction of duplexes. I think this would be especially beneficial on lots near 680 freeway exits, close to Danville Boulevard, in areas closer to Walnut Creek, and on lots adjacent to Alamo Plaza. it is hard to make a case that the "harm" to existing Alamo residents would outweigh the benefits, when 2 million California families are paying more than half their salary in rent.

I would also like to remind you that single family zoning started as an exclusionary tool, often with racial underpinnings. Berkeley was a single family zoning pioneer. In 1915, the Berkeley City Attorney justified single family zoning as a way to protect homes from "deterioration", especially from the intrusion of "undesirables" and "heathen Chinese". While zoning may not be based in racial animus, it's an effective way to push out people who were not able to buy cheap homes decades ago (or pass them on to their kids).

Duplexes would help our young families, and Alamo's service workers, be able to afford and gain a foothold in Alamo. Duplexes would provide more customers for Alamo businesses. Your election website also mentioned tackling homelessness; many of Contra Costa County's homeless population were in homes in Contra Costa County before going onto the street. Adding more homes will make the region as a whole more affordable, and help keep rents lower for others who may be struggling.

Thanks for your thoughts,
<your name>
