My name is Kevin Burke, I live in Belmont, I'm a small business owner and a
renter. I'm trying to save up enough to buy a home. I'm here to speak in support
of approving all 9800 units immediately.

My basketball coach used to say "There's never a good time to practice." There
are always more fun things to do - watch TV, sleep in, hang out with friends.

I'm reminded of this when I hear about new housing. "There's never a good place
for a new home" - there's always some problem with a proposed site, whether it's
shadows, or parking, or height, or schools, or "neighborhood character." We need
to try to build anyway because when we don't we build in Gilroy and Livermore
instead, with really long commutes, which are way worse for the environment and
for the region as a whole.

A lot of people have raised concerns about schools and traffic. I would like to
remind the Council that the people that would bear the brunt of these problems
are the people that would move into the new housing. And yet, I don't think
there's anyone in this room that thinks a developer would have trouble finding
buyers and renters for the lot.

That suggests that **for a lot of people having an affordable place to live is
much more important than whether there's traffic or whether the schools are
a little crowded.** Even if traffic everyday is like a Shoreline concert
I guarantee you there are people that will be grateful at least they're not
commuting from Gilroy. The Council should take that value judgement into
account.

- Something about 3k units vs all 9800

- Something about GOOG wanting this project & having $10B in cash & equivalents
on hand; surely they can help

- something about City Attorney and legality of denying project based on
insufficient schools
