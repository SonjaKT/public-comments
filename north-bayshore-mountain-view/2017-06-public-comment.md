My name is Kevin Burke, I live in Belmont, I'm a small business owner and a
renter. I'm trying to save up enough to buy a home. I'm here to speak in support
of approving all 9800 units immediately.

"There's never a good place for a new home" - there's always going to be a
problem with a proposed site, whether it's shadows, or parking, or height, or
schools, or "neighborhood character." We need to try to build anyway because
when we don't we build in Gilroy and Livermore instead, with really long
commutes, which are way worse for the environment and for the region as a whole.

A lot of people have raised concerns about schools and traffic. I would like to
remind the Council that the people that would bear the brunt of these problems
are the people that would move into the new housing. And yet, I don't think
there's anyone in this room that thinks a developer would have trouble finding
buyers and renters for the lot.

That suggests that **for a lot of people having an affordable place to live
is much more important than whether there's traffic or whether the schools
are a little crowded.** Even if traffic everyday is like a Shoreline concert
I guarantee you there are people that will be grateful at least they're not
commuting from Gilroy. The Council should take that value judgement into
account. Personally I would much rather have a parking crisis or a school crisis
than a housing crisis. Google also supports this project, they have 10 billion
dollars in cash and cash equivalents when I checked this morning, if there are
problems that money can solve they should be solvable.

I think the Council should approve all 9800 units at once. 3000 units wouldn't
be sufficient to support a grocery store or transit. It would also open the door
to denying later phases of the project.

I would also like to remind the Council that it's against the law to take
insufficient schools into account when making housing decisions.
