# All about the North Bayshore housing proposal

The City of Mountain View is deciding how much housing to allow on the North
Bayshore property, roughly the area between Highway 101, the Shoreline
Amphitheater, NASA Ames Research Center, and Palo Alto.

They are holding two meetings to discuss it:

- The Environmental Planning Commission is meeting Wednesday June 21, 7pm, at
  500 Castro Street. The Commission will vote on a recommendation to make to the
  City Council.

- The City Council is holding deliberations and (probably) a vote on the North
Bayshore plan on Tuesday June 27 at 6:30pm at 500 Castro Street.

Specifically they're going to vote on an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) that
could allow up to 9850 housing units to be built in the area. Once they certify
the EIR, developers can submit an application to build housing on it.

## What could happen at the two meetings?

9850 is on the high end of the proposed number of allowed housing units for
the area. In the past, the staff has framed the decision to the City Council
in terms of a low-density plan (~3000 units total) or a high density plan with
7000-9800 units. The City Council could vote to reduce the number of allowable
units, or delay certification altogether.

## Why should we build 9850 units of housing there?

From a *regional* perspective, it is a no-brainer to add the maximum number of
housing units. Santa Clara County added 200,000 jobs between 2010 and 2016, and
only added 30,000 units of housing. This jobs-housing imbalance has pushed rents
and home prices to record highs.

Building more housing helps lower rents, relative to not building, which puts
more money in renters pockets. Google has discussed how it's harder to meet
hiring goals because it's so expensive to live here, and YCombinator partners
frequently talk about how high rents make startups less viable.

In addition, failing to build housing close to job sites contributes to sprawl.
Three of the fastest growing cities in the Bay Area were [Gilroy, Brentwood and
Rio Vista][sprawl]. The people living there have lawns and long commutes, which
are not good for the environment.

The high price of housing is making it more difficult for cities and businesses
on the Peninsula to fill positions in schools, restaurants, and police
stations. Many of the people who fill these jobs commute two hours or more.
Building housing closer to jobs (and especially, close to Google's campus) is a
no-brainer for the economy and the environment. Even if your housing situation
is OK, consider the many people you talk to every day might have high rents and
long commutes, or the effect on your kids education if their school can't hire
teachers.

## That all sounds bad. Why wouldn't they approve the maximum number of units?

From a *local* perspective things are far more muddy. While building housing
close to jobs is beneficial for the region as a whole, it's likely to have a
local impact on things like traffic. Residents that refuse to allow housing
development can push up their own property values.

**Furthermore** the tools used to analyze the environmental impacts are flawed.
They consider only the localized environmental impacts on traffic, noise, green
space, pollution, and do not consider the long run consequences of failing to
build enough housing close to jobs (sprawl).

In sum the City Council is looking at a flawed environmental report, there will
probably be lots of opposition, and it's not clear what they are going to do
next Tuesday.

## How can I help?

You can **let the City Council know that you want them to certify the EIR with
the maximum allowable number of units.** Feel free to paraphrase the facts
above. If you work in Mountain View, or want to buy a home/condo in Mountain
View, be sure to mention that. If you live in Mountain View, be sure to mention
that.

Public speaking is awkward as hell. I understand that. But the Council
often sees these events as "50 people spoke in opposition and 10 in favor"
and I guarantee you are more eloquent than the average speaker. So get up
there and tell the City Council what you are concerned about and maybe a
sentence or two about why you think that should be the case. "I want to live
near where I work" / "I am worried we aren't building enough housing for
teachers/firefighters/police" / "Not building enough contributes to sprawl and
long commutes"

If you can't make it to the meeting, **email the City Council and tell them
what you think.** I have created a form that makes it easy to send personalized
emails to each City Council member, using your GMail account. [Click here to

**Contact your C-level executives and VC's and ask them to show up.** The high
cost of housing is hurting job creation and the region's vitality as a startup
hub. Ultimately this hurts everyone. Hopefully they can let the City Council
know how the high price of housing is affecting their company(ies) ability to
hire and be competitive.
