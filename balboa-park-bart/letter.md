I'm a lifelong Bay Area resident and lived in SF for 5 years. I just moved to
Belmont in part because of the high price of city housing. I hope to move back
soon.

Please build the version of the plan that adds the most housing units. There is
no more pressing need than the production of more housing in the Bay Area.

Since 2010 we've added 2.3 million residents in California and only 400,000 new
housing units. As a predictable result, prices have gone through the roof. I'm
a small business owner and high rents make it difficult to hire and grow my
business since labor costs are so high. Google just admitted it's much easier
for them to hire in Seattle because housing is so expensive here. Housing
prices are hurting our businesses. More housing would help lower rents and add
customers, helping our businesses stay afloat.

We've seen that building new housing can decrease rents. Last year SF built 5000
new units, a record, and rents and owner move-in evictions both declined. We
should keep those trends moving in the right direction by continuing to build
more housing.

Building lots of apartments near transit is smart policy. It's great for the
environment, since it's easy for people to commute and Balboa Park has great
public transit options. Parking may be a concern but I think it's far outweighed
by the need of people to have a place to live where they don't have to pay 50%
of their salary in rent. If tough parking forces people to circle the block a
few times so be it. If it gets them to use public transit more, or ride sharing
services, we all win because there are fewer cars on the road.

Thanks,
Kevin
